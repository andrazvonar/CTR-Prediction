# CTR Prediction
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for processing and building a CTR prediction model. CTR or click trough rate is the rato of users that click on a specific ad compared to the total number of users that visit the website that displays the ad.

# Processing data
In the process CTR data notebook we clean and preprocess our dataset for learning. First we select features that will be used for learning. Next, we encode values using hashing.

# Building our models
In the End model notebook, we first build a simple logistic regression model and then build a more complex deep learning model. Our neural network is made up of 3 dense layers with 2 dropout layers in between.
